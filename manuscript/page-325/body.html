I could only look at Stroeve in stupid amazement.</p><p>"We both loved Blanche. There would have been room for him in my mother's house. I think the company of poor, simple people would have done his soul a great good. I think he might have learnt from them something that would be very useful to him."</p><p>"What did he say?"</p><p>"He smiled a little. I suppose he thought me very silly. He said he had other fish to fry."</p><p>I could have wished that Strickland had used some other phrase to indicate his refusal.</p><p>"He gave me the picture of Blanche."</p><p>I wondered why Strickland had done that.
