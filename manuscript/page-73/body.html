There never was a better woman in the world."</p><p>Since these confidences were thrust on me, I saw no harm in asking a few questions.</p><p>"But do you mean to say she suspected nothing?"</p><p>"Nothing. He spent August with her and the children in Norfolk. He was just the same as he'd always been. We went down for two or three days, my wife and I, and I played golf with him. He came back to town in September to let his partner go away, and Amy stayed on in the country. They'd taken a house for six weeks, and at the end of her tenancy she wrote to tell him on which day she was arriving in London. He answered from Paris. He said he'd made up his mind not to live with her any more."</p><p>"What explanation did he give?"</p><p>"My dear fellow, he gave no explanation. I've seen the letter. It wasn't more than ten lines."</p></div> </div>
