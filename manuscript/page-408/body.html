<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">red-tiled floor, a large wooden bed, and on a deal table a ewer and a basin. A motley crowd saunters along the streetsâ€”Lascars off a P. and O., blond Northmen from a Swedish barque, Japanese from a man-of-war, English sailors, Spaniards, pleasant-looking fellows from a French cruiser, negroes off an American tramp. By day it is merely sordid, but at night, lit only by the lamps in the little huts, the street has a sinister beauty. The hideous lust that pervades the air is oppressive and horrible, and yet there is something mysterious in the sight which haunts and troubles you. You feel I know not what primitive force which repels and yet fascinates you. Here all the decencies of civilisation are swept away, and you feel that men are face to face with a sombre reality. There is an atmosphere that is at once intense and tragic.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In the bar in which Strickland and Nichols sat a mechanical piano was loudly grinding out dance music.</p></div> </div>
